One of my favorite PhD-related tasks is teaching students (and trying to make them as passionate as I am about signal processing). This year, I am teaching assistant at the EPL for the following courses:

LELEC2102: Project in Electrical Engineering: Integration of wireless embedded sensing systems (master students).
LELEC2885: Image Processing and Computer Vision (master students);
During my studies, I also gave exercice sessions to younger students in a wide variety of subjects: Wave and quantum physics, signal and system processing, electricity.
