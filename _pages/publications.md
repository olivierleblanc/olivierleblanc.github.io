        <p>The walking droplet
          experiment has received particular attention in the last fifteen years 
          because it represents the first known example of a macroscopic pilot-wave 
          system that exhibits behaviours thought to be exclusive to the microscopic 
          quantum realm. Most efforts about walking droplets have focused on the 
          experimental analysis in a <q>fluid mechanics</q> framework and on its 
          mathematical modeling. On the other hand, the stadium billiard, one of 
          the first 2D concave chaotic geometries introduced by Bunimovich, has 
          been actively studied for these last decades because of the drastic 
          differences observed between classical and quantum particles behaviour 
          in such geometry. Consequently, the objective of this master thesis is 
          to analyze the behaviour of walking droplets inside the Bunimovich stadium 
          billiard and compare it with the behaviours of classical and quantum 
          particles in similar conditions. To fulfil this objective, a complete 
          low-cost experimental setup has been developed for the observations of
          walking droplets, comprising : a fabricated bath stuck on the membrane of 
          a loudspeaker for the vertical shaking, a 3-axis accelerometer providing 
          real-time measurements on PC, a droplet generator based on a piezoelectric 
          buzzer and a fixed camera recording top view images of the droplet motion 
          which are post-processed with Matlab. The imperfect horizontality of the 
          developed setup is shown to lead to an effective Faraday instability 
          threshold lower than the scientific consensus for the same forcing 
          parameters \( \Gamma_{F,e} = 2.3[\text{g}] < \Gamma_F = 4.144[\text g] \). 
          As it prevents us to correctly estimate the memory parameter 
          Me, the conducted experiments are instead described in terms of shaking 
          amplitude Γ and estimated tilt angles of the bath θ and β. It is observed 
          that the walking droplet long-term evolution in a stadium billiard presents 
          a clear scarring pattern, informing on the existence of preferred 
          <q>probable positions</q> of the droplet inside the billiard. 
          The scarring pattern, while very similar to a typical shape found in 
          quantum simulations, is surprisingly much more robust against forcing 
          variations than the scars observed  
          for electrons.</p>
