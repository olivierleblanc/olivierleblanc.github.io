### About Me

I earned my BSc in electromechanical engineering and MSc in electrical engineering.

<!-- Throughout my studies I was involved in several science projects that 
used large amounts of data to discover patterns and model phenomena.

My interests range from machine learning, data engineering to 
computational optimization, and high performance computing.

In my spare time I enjoy taking walks, learning new languages, 
drawing, and sometimes playing the guitar. -->

I am a PhD student at UCLouvain in Louvain-la-Neuve under the supervision of [Pr. Laurent Jacques](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/laurent.jacques). Find my complete cursus and more about me here.

### Research

My research is about drawing on signal processing insights to reduce the computational cost of machine learning methods; see more on my research page. Don't hesitate to also check out my list of publications and related code.

I work within Institute of Signal Processing Group (ISPG) and my research topic is *GeneCI: Physically-Driven and Generative Neural Networks for Computational Imaging*.
