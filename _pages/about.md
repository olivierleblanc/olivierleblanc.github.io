Welcome to my homepage! I am a PhD student at UCLouvain in Louvain-la-Neuve <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Louvain-la-Neuve,+1348+Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve/@50.6680791,4.5943228,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47c17e05f083ac27:0x171325f53f02977e!8m2!3d50.668081!4d4.6118324" width="600" height="450" frameborder="0" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe> under the supervision of [Pr. Laurent Jacques](https://uclouvain.be/en/directories/laurent.jacques). I am affiliated to the ISPgroup research team. Find my complete cursus and more about me here.

My research is about drawing on signal processing insights to reduce the computational cost of machine learning methods; see more on my research page. Don't hesitate to also check out my list of publications and related code.

 I work within Institute of Signal Processing Group (ISPG) and my research topic is *GeneCI: Physically-Driven and Generative Neural Networks for Computational Imaging*.
