<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This article is based on the work I did for a project that involved 
millions of documents in different languages. The goal was to build a system 
that could retrieve documents in multiple languages based on an input query in 
one language. The purpose of this article is to give a very high-level picture 
of concepts, ideas, and tools that could be used for building such a system.</p>

<p>Most of the things mentioned here are connected to 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing" target="_blank">Natural Processing Language</a> 
(NLP) field. However, as you will see, this type of a system could be used for 
multiple problems, not just for NLP, as it relies on vector representation and 
efficient vector similarity matching.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you are completely new to the NLP field some of the things mentioned here 
will be unclear. I’ll do my best to give small explanations and reference 
material where you can find more information.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s not possible to cover everything since this topic is elaborate and a 
subject to constant change but I’ll try to go over the following topics:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Big Picture</strong> - a brief overview of some NLP/ANN concepts</li>
  <li><strong>Techniques</strong> - techniques and methods for dealing with large amount of 
high-dimensional vector representations</li>
  <li><strong>Examples</strong> - open source libraries and code snippets</li>
</ul>

<p><br /></p>
<h1 id="the-big-picture">The Big Picture</h1>

<h3 id="seq2seq">Seq2Seq</h3>

<p>We can look at the translation as a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seq2seq" target="_blank">sequence-to-sequence</a> 
(seq2seq) problem which translates a sequence from one domain to a sequence in 
another domain. This is achieved using <strong>encoder-decoder</strong> infrastructure, 
where a sentence is an input for encoder which encodes it to a fixed-length 
internal representation that is used by decoder to give an output.</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>Neural networks, especially RNNs are well suited for this task. However, 
there’s a problem. As sentences become larger, we notice a decline in the 
performance of the network, also known as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem" target="_blank">vanishing gradient problem</a>. 
This gave birth to the new mechanism called <strong>attention</strong> which tries to solve 
this by focusing on parts of input sequences. There are several attention 
mechanisms and you can take a deep dive into them by reading: 
<a href="https://medium.com/@edloginova/attention-in-nlp-734c6fa9d983" target="_blank">Attention in NLP</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Self-attention</strong> is one of the attention mechanisms that was used to create 
a novel encode-decoder architecture: <strong>the transformer</strong>.  It’s detailed in the 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank">Attention Is All You Need</a> 
paper and it completely changed the NLP field. It introduced a new approach to 
solving seq2seq tasks while handling long-range dependencies with ease. This 
architecture relies solely on the self-attention mechanism without using 
sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution. The transformer is highly parallelizable 
and requires less time to train.</p>

<h3 id="the-bert-family">The BERT Family</h3>

<p>The BERT stands for <em><strong>B</strong>idirectional <strong>E</strong>ncoder <strong>R</strong>epresentations from 
<strong>T</strong>ransformers</em>, and is a language representation model based on Transformer 
encoder network. As mentioned above, that network can process long texts 
efficiently because it relies on the self-attention mechanism.</p>

<p>The network contains 12 successive transformer layers, 12 attention heads 
(each layer has one), 768 hidden units, and 110 million parameters.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Of course, the actual numbers depend on the type of the model: base, large, 
etc. If you’d like to find out more, I suggest reading:

<p>Here’s a nice 3D image that depicts the network:</p>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>The output of this model is a high-dimensional vector. The number of dimensions 
is equal to hidden units i.e. 768.</p>

<p>This model has been released to the public with pre-trained weights. 
Pre-training a model is quite expensive, takes a lot of time, and requires a huge 
amount of data. That’s why the pre-trained weights are important and we can 
easily fine tune the model for our purposes and specific aims.</p>

<p>There are other models based on BERT such as:

</blockquote>

<p>Out of this plethora of models I would distinguish 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02116" target="_blank">XLMRoBERTa</a>. XLM stands 
for <em>Cross-lingual Language Model</em> and RoBERTa for <em>Robustly Optimized BERT 
Pretraining Approach</em>.</p>

<p>XLMRoBERTa is a multilingual model and is trained on 100 different languages. 
What makes it so awesome is that it doesn’t require <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lang</code> tensor to understand 
which language is used since it’s able to determine the correct language based 
on input ids.</p>

<h3 id="approximate-nearest-neighbors">Approximate Nearest Neighbors</h3>

<h4 id="basics">Basics</h4>

<p>As amount of data grows each day and data applications struggle to be 
responsive and efficient, some business requirements and data operations 
as <em>similarity search</em> create insurmountable issues.</p>

<p>There are different methods of searching, but as we scale to millions or 
billions data entries we have to implement optimized solutions such as 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor" target="_blank">approximate nearest neighbors</a> (ANN) algorithms. The trick here is that we are forced to 
trade some accuracy in order to achieve a similarity search that can be orders 
of magnitude faster.</p>

<p>ANN techniques speed up the search by preprocessing the data into an efficient 
index. This is achieved by transforming vectors before they are indexed, such as 
dimensionality reduction, vector rotation, and encoding to a much compact form in 
order to construct the actual index etc.</p>

<p>There are several popular methods of building ANNs, some of which are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Encoding using trees</strong>: It creates a binary tree that partitions a vector 
space. The trick here is that the points that are close to each other in the 
vector space are most likely to be close to each other in the tree. The 
popular implementation of this approach is 
<a href="https://github.com/spotify/annoy" target="_blank">Annoy</a>, which is developed 
and used by Spotify to implement music recommendation system.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Encoding using LSH</strong>: 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing" target="_blank">Locality-sensitive hashing</a> is used to create “buckets” of similar input items which enables this technique to be used for 
data clustering and implementation of approximate nearest neighbors. The 
popular implementation of this approach is 
<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss" target="_blank">FAISS</a>. 
When applied to vector space LSH will result in partition of vector space into 
buckets based on similarity between vectors.</li>
</ul>

    </figure>
</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Encoding using Quantization</strong>: Another approach is to map the vector space 
into a smaller collection of representative vectors (also called <strong>codebook</strong>). 
For example we could find these vector by running a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering" target="_blank">K-means</a> 
clustering algorithm. This results in a partitioning of the vector space into 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" target="_blank">Voronoi cells</a> 
where the representative vector is a cluster centroid of a cell.</li>

    </figure>
</div>

<p>This allows us to query only the representative vectors. Of course, this 
approach lowers the accuracy of the search but it significantly increases 
the response time.</p>

<p>All these methods approximate nearest neighbors and speed up similarity search 
but when we deal with millions or billions of documents, these representative 
vectors can be quite heavy, especially if they are high dimensional (which 
happens in NLP).</p>

<p>Another method to lower the space required for these vectors is 
<strong>Product Quantization</strong> which basically approximates the distance/similarity 
calculation by compressing the vectors. This is achieved by splitting the 
vector into equal length subvectors and then assigning these subvectors to its 
nearest centroids.</p>

<h4 id="faiss">FAISS</h4>

<p>FAISS stands for <em>Facebook AI Similarity Search</em> and is a C++ library (with 
Python bindings) that implements efficient similarity search when the number 
of vectors goes up to millions or billions. It also comes with built-in GPU 
optimization for any CUDA-enabled machine.</p>

<p>Let’s say we have a set of vectors \(x_i\) of dimension \(d\). Using these 
vectors, FAISS builds a data structure called <em>index</em>, where it stores vectors 
for efficient matching, and then for a new vector \(x\) of dimension \(d\) it 
efficiently performs:</p>

\[j = \mathrm{argmin}_i||x-x_i||\]

<p>where \(\mid\mid\cdot\mid\mid\) is the Euclidean distance (\(L^2\)) and 
\(\mathrm{argmin}\) is the search operation on the index.</p>

<p>When we look at <a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Faiss-indexes" target="_blank">types of indexes</a> 
we can see that we have over 10 types to choose from: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexFlatL2</code>, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexFlatIP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexHNSWFlat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexIVFFlat</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexLSH</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexPQ</code>, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexIVFScalarQuantizer</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexIVFPQ</code>, etc.</p>

<p>So, how do we know which one to use?</p>

<p>It really depends on the use case. It’s obvious that we will always have to 
trade some accuracy for speed but also the number of vectors plays a huge role in 
choosing the right index type. To better understand the meaning of index names, 
let’s cover the important ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Flat</strong> is used to label indexes that store whole vectors without compression</li>
</ul>

<p>For example <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IndexFlatL2</code> measures \(L^2\) distance between all uncompressed 
vectors in an index and the query vector. Obviously, it’s very accurate but not 
efficient and won’t work well for large scale search.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>IVF</strong> stands for <em>inverted file index</em> and is used to partition vector space 
into \(N\) partitions</li>
</ul>

<p>However, here we have to train the index. This is required in order to add 
groupings and build the index. Partitioning of vector space speeds up the 
process of querying since we are first matching the main vector of each 
cluster, or if you like to think in visual terms, each Voronoi cell.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this approximation can lead to suboptimal results. One way to 
improve it is to increase <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nprobe</code> parameter, which defines the number of 
nearby cells to search. Think of it as probing cells, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nprobe</code> is 5, we 
visit 5 cells and get the one which has the best result, if we probe 15 cells, 
the probability of getting the best cells with best vectors in it increases.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>LSH</strong> stands for <em>Locality Sensitive Hashing</em> which we already mentioned. 
Index can also be built using LSH to partition vector space and use cell-probe 
methods to probe partitions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>PQ</strong> stands for <em>Product Quantization</em> as mentioned earlier and is used to 
compress vectors. This is used if storing the whole vector is too expensive 
and is considered to be most useful indexing structure for large-scale search</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are more details about choosing the best index structure for your use 
case: 
<a href="https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss/wiki/Guidelines-to-choose-an-index" target="_blank">Guidelines to choose an index</a></p>

<p>Usually the index is stored in RAM, but if it gets too large it can be store 
on a disk, which of course has some performance impact.</p>

<p>What makes FAISS’ API really awesome for developing applications is that it 
can return not just the nearest neighbor but also \(k\)-th nearest neighbor, 
perform search in batches, and also return results in a defined range of 
similarity score.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Let’s play around with these concepts using an open source library: 
<a href="https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers" target="_blank">sentence-transformers</a>, 
that provides an easy method to compute dense vector representations for 
sentences, paragraphs, and images. This framework can be used for: Computing 
Sentence Embeddings, Semantic Textual Similarity, Clustering and many more.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I suggest setting up a virtual environment for managing packages. You could 
use <a href="https://python-poetry.org/docs/" target="_blank">Poetry</a> or 
<a href="https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">pipenv</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To install <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sentence-transformers</code> you’ll need <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">python &gt;= 3.6</code>, 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PyTorch &gt;= 1.6.0</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">transformers &gt;= v4.6.0</code>.</p>

<h3 id="computing-sentence-embeddings">Computing Sentence Embeddings</h3>

<p>To use pretrained models, specify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">model_name</code> parameter for 
<a href="https://www.sbert.net/docs/package_reference/SentenceTransformer.html" target="_blank"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SentenceTransformer</code></a>. 
The models are hosted on HuggingFace Model Hub, the code will automatically 
pull the model and cache it locally:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">from</span> <span class="nn">sentence_transformers</span> <span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">SentenceTransformer</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SentenceTransformer</code> has <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">encode</code> method that computes the embeddings, we 
can pass a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">str</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">List[str]</code>:</p>

<p>We can see that we get 3 vectors with 768 dimensions, as we expected.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">util.cos_sim(a[i], b[j])</code> computes the cosine similarity for all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">i</code> and 
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">j</code> and we already know that this won’t work if we have large amount of

<p>For presentational purposes, let’s play with a collection of email messages of 
employees in the Enron Corporation which can be found at 
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/aeslc" target="_blank">AESLC</a>. 
We won’t deal with cleaning and preparing the data, that would make article too 
long, and accuracy is not the main focus of this article.</p>

<p>Since these emails can be very long and we are using BERT-based model which has 
sentence length of 512 word pieces, we have to implement a simple solution 
that will divide a sentence into chunks and compute embeddings for each chunk 
then combine it. I suggest you take a look at:

and

The Dow Jones report is compiled of data sent from many different  counterparties.
The lovely people at Dow Jones painstakingly analyze the data  to ensure its accuracy.
Averaged together, these prices become the Dow Jones  daily index price.
And that's the long and short of it.
The process, as you've guessed by now, is a little more complicated than  that.
For one thing, Dow Jones looks at each counterparty's sales to reach an  average of all the prices.
It would be redundant for each counterparty to  ALSO report their purchases from each other.
Therefore, when calculating the  Dow Jones data, we only include purchases from counterparties who ARE NOT  participants in the Dow Jones survey.
Following is a simple example:  Participant List  NP-15 Purchases  NP-15 Sales  Reported NP-15 Purchases  Reported NP-15 Sales Sempra  Sempra - $250   Sempra - $250  Avista - $270   Sempra - $250 Duke   Duke - $260   Duke - $260      Duke - $260 Enron   Avista - $270   Avista - $270      Avista - $270  Now that's simple!
Following is the participant list for Dow Jones' survey of trading at NP-15  and SP-15 delivery points.
Deals with these counterparty names need to be  excluded from the calculation of PURCHASES at NP-15 and SP-15 delivery points.
American Electric Power - Amerelecpo Avista Energy - Avistaene Duke Energy Trading and Marketing - Dukeenetra El Paso Merchant Energy Enron Power Marketing, Inc. - EPMI Idaho Power Company - Idacorpene PacifiCorp - PACE Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company - PG&amp;E Powerex Corp. - PWX Puget Sound Energy, Inc. - PSPL Mirant Americas Energy Marketing (formerly Southern Company Energy Marketing)  - SCEM TransAlta Energy Marketing (US) Inc. - Transalt  So I've probably succeeded in confusing you even more, but please feel free  to come bug me with questions.
Good luck!

The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery  points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26.
Please let me know if you have  any problems opening the document or reading it.
The worksheet should look  identical to the fax I send each day.
An additional worksheet shows a detail  of each deal volume and price.
I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty  names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet  normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the  prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.
Thanks,

Holden &amp; Lisa -  Per Holden, I've changed deal 630176 from a price of $170 to $197.
Terms and reasons are as follows:       6/4/01  STSW buys EPE   49 mw/HLH        The other side of this deal is a sale to El Paso for $204.
Kathy questioned the invoice she received from Houston this month, because the breakdown of transmission costs and fees we had given her (regarding buy-resales done by your desk on 6/1, 6/2, and 6/4) amounted to a spread of $14.06.
The deals we entered into our system, and subsequently billed El Paso for, amounted to spreads of $14.06 for 6/1,       $11.06 for 6/2, and $34 for 6/4.
To remedy this, and extend a gesture of apology for the mistake, we've changed our buy from El Paso on  the 4th to a price of $197, leaving a spread of $7 to cover our transmission costs.
I've explained this to Kathy at El Paso and Amy in Settlements, and wanted to give both of you a record of the change as well.
Please let      me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,

<p>Query with trade lists and spreadsheets, returns emails which topics revolve 
around prices, Dow Jones, sales, etc, which is not surprising.</p>

<h3 id="simple-system">Simple System</h3>

<p>Let’s say that you want to implement semantic search in your application that 
has the usual frontend and backend infrastructure. One of the ways to test 
ideas is to create a simple system that will use FAISS as an API.</p>

<p>The easiest way to achieve that is to wrap a FAISS index with something 
like <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/" target="_blank">Flask</a>. 
The idea is to have a Flask server that is completely decoupled from your 
backend, it will search the FAISS index that you created and your backend can 
create API calls to the flask server.</p>

<p>This can be further integrated with a full-text search engine like 
Elasticsearch. Elasticsearch’s support for text/sentence embeddings is fairly 
new, limited, and a field of ongoing work (Ref: 
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/blog/text-similarity-search-with-vectors-in-elasticsearch" target="_blank">Text similarity search with vector fields</a>
). There are plugins that can implement ANN solutions in Elasticsearch as 
described here: 
<a href="https://medium.com/gsi-technology/scalable-semantic-vector-search-with-elasticsearch-e79f9145ba8e" target="_blank">Scalable Semantic Vector Search with Elasticsearch</a>. 
However, as an exercise we can implement ANN separately and keep 
Elasticsearch’s native search possibilities for certain types of queries.</p>

<p>It would look like this:</p>

<div class="figure-div">
    <figure>
        
        <img src="/assets/images/posts/semantic-search/semantic-diagram.jpg" alt="semantic-diagram" />
        
        
            <figcaption>Illustration of a simple system idea</figcaption>
        
    </figure>
</div>

<p><strong>front</strong> represents an API that communicates with Elastisearch and a FAISS 
API - labeled as <strong>semantic</strong>, it proxies API calls based on queries that can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>native</strong> - full-text Elasticsearch queries</li>
  <li><strong>semantic</strong> - semantic query that returns first top N hits</li>
  <li><strong>semantic range</strong> - semantic query that returns all articles in a defined 
range of similarity score</li>
</ul>

<p>When your application makes a semantic query, <em>front</em> will first create a call 
to <em>semantic</em> to get the document ids that are either first top N hits or in a 
defined range of similarity score, and then it will get those documents from 
Elasticsearch (or any other engine/database).</p>

<p>If you would like to learn more about this and checkout the code, please see 
the sample project on my github: 
<a href="https://github.com/VladimirSiv/semantic-search-system" target="_blank">Semantic Search System</a>.</p>

<h2 id="final-words">Final Words</h2>

<p>My aim was to give a brief introduction to what happens behind a semantic search 
system and how it works. Concepts are introduced at a very high level which, I 
hope, helps you see the big picture more clearly.</p>

<p>There are many details which I didn’t cover. Dealing with different models, 
accuracy, different methods of processing long texts and many more play a 
significant role in performance of the search.</p>

<p>Examples are there to show you how you can play with these concepts, explore 
them and create toy applications. If you are interested in finding out more, 
please go through provided material and resources.</p>

<p>If you have any questions or suggestions, please reach out, I’m always 
available.</p>
