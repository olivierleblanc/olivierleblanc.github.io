  abstract = {Computational imaging has revolutionized our capabilities to sense the environment, enabling a wide range of applications in domains like medical, biological, or radio-astronomical imaging. This thesis broadens the scope of the computational imaging framework in two main directions.
First, the principle of compressive imaging---i.e. capturing the image information with few linear projections data---is applied to two interferometric imaging applications, namely multicore fiber lensless imaging and radio-interferometry. In both cases, it is shown that compressive imaging is possible with random projections applied at the level of the interfering elements, resulting in a linear sensing model involving Fourier subsampling and rank-one projections. In addition to the analysis of their computational complexities, the sensing models are accompanied by uniform recovery guarantees highlighting their sample complexities---the number of interfering elements and number of measurements required for image recovery. The theoretical sample complexities are confirmed numerically, and also experimentally for multicore fiber imaging. 
Second, contributions are brought to the field of diffraction tomography, proposing a combination of an implicit neural representation---a continuous image representation by a neural network---and a nonlinear (multiple-scattering) sensing model. Significant efforts are made in a review of the different ways to model electromagnetic wave diffraction through inhomogeneous media, leveraging first-order optimization methods to solve the subsequent linear system of equations. The reconstruction of the 3-D image through the weights of an implicit neural representation instead of discrete voxels is proposed for this nonlinear sensing model, demonstrating the benefit of (i) the nonlinearity over linear approximations of the model, and (ii) the continuous representation for handling rotations of the object. The drawbacks of the approach are highlighted and improvements necessary for experimental use are discussed.},

  abstract = {Radio-interferometry (RI) observes the sky at unprecedented angular resolutions, enabling the study of several far-away galactic objects such as galaxies and black holes. In RI, an array of antennas probes cosmic signals coming from the observed region of the sky. The covariance matrix of the vector gathering all these antenna measurements offers, by leveraging the Van Cittert-Zernike theorem, an incomplete and noisy Fourier sensing of the image of interest. The number of noisy Fourier measurements---or \emph{visibilities}---scales as \( \mathcal O(Q^2B) \) for \( Q \) antennas and \( B \) short-time integration (STI) intervals. We address the challenges posed by this vast volume of data, which is anticipated to increase significantly with the advent of large antenna arrays, by proposing a compressive sensing technique applied directly at the level of the antenna measurements. First, this paper shows that \emph{beamforming}---a common technique of dephasing antenna signals---usually used to focus some region of the sky, is equivalent to sensing a rank-one projection (ROP) of the signal covariance matrix. We build upon our recent work \cite{leblanc24} to propose a compressive sensing scheme relying on random beamforming, trading the \( Q^2\)-dependence of the data size for a smaller number \( N_{\mathrm p} \) ROPs. We provide image recovery guarantees for sparse image reconstruction. Secondly, the data size is made independent of \( B )\ by applying \( N_{\mathrm m} \) Bernoulli modulations of the ROP vectors obtained for the STI. The resulting sample complexities, theoretically derived in a simpler case without modulations and numerically obtained in phase transition diagrams, are shown to scale as \( \mathcal O(K) \) where \( K \) is the image sparsity. This illustrates the potential of the approach. },

  abstract= { Image reconstruction in off-axis Terahertz digital holography is complicated due to the harsh recording conditions and the non-convexity form of the problem. In this paper, we propose an inverse problem-based reconstruction technique that jointly reconstructs the object field and the amplitude of the reference field. Regularization in the wavelet domain promotes a sparse object solution. A single objective function combining the data-fidelity and regularization terms is optimized with a dedicated algorithm based on an Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers framework. Each iteration alternates between two consecutive optimizations using projections operating on each solution and one soft thresholding operator applying to the object solution. The method is preceded by a windowing process to alleviate artifacts due to the mismatch between camera frame truncation and periodic boundary conditions assumed to implement convolution operators. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, in particular, improvements of reconstruction quality, compared to two other methods.},

  abstract= {A broad class of problems in scientific disciplines ranging from image processing and astrophysics, to geophysics and medical imaging call for the optimization of convex, non-smooth objective functions. Whereas practitioners are usually familiar with gradient-based algorithms, commonly used to solve unconstrained, smooth optimization problems, proximal algorithms can be viewed as analogous tools for non-smooth and possibly constrained versions of such problems. These algorithms sit at a higher level of abstraction than gradient-based algorithms and require a basic operation to be performed at each iteration: the evaluation of the so-called proximal operator of the functional to be optimized. PyProximal is a Python-based library aimed at democratizing the application of convex optimization to scientific problems; it provides the required building blocks (i.e., proximal operators and algorithms) to define and solve complex, convex objective functions in a high-level, abstract fashion, shielding users away from any unneeded mathematical and implementation details.},

On a practical side, we perform a single calibration of the sensing system robust to certain deviations to the theoretical model and independent of the sketching vectors used during the imaging phase.

  abstract = {The walking droplet experiment has received particular      attention in the last fifteen years because it represents the first known example of a macroscopic pilot-wave system that exhibits behaviours thought to be exclusive to the microscopic quantum realm. Most efforts about walking droplets have focused on the experimental analysis in a <q>fluid mechanics</q> framework and on its mathematical modeling. On the other hand, the stadium billiard, one of the first 2D concave chaotic geometries introduced by Bunimovich, has been actively studied for these last decades because of the drastic differences observed between classical and quantum particles behaviour in such geometry. Consequently, the objective of this master thesis is to analyze the behaviour of walking droplets inside the Bunimovich stadium billiard and compare it with the behaviours of classical and quantum particles in similar conditions. To fulfil this objective, a complete low-cost experimental setup has been developed for the observations of walking droplets, comprising : a fabricated bath stuck on the membrane of a loudspeaker for the vertical shaking, a 3-axis accelerometer providing real-time measurements on PC, a droplet generator based on a piezoelectric buzzer and a fixed camera recording top view images of the droplet motion which are post-processed with Matlab. The imperfect horizontality of the developed setup is shown to lead to an effective Faraday instability threshold lower than the scientific consensus for the same forcing parameters \( \Gamma_{F,e} = 2.3[\text g] < \Gamma_F = 4.144[\text g] \). As it prevents us to correctly estimate the memory parameter Me, the conducted experiments are instead described in terms of shaking amplitude Γ and estimated tilt angles of the bath θ and β. It is observed that the walking droplet long-term evolution in a stadium billiard presents a clear scarring pattern, informing on the existence of preferred <q>probable positions</q> of the droplet inside the billiard. The scarring pattern, while very similar to a typical shape found in quantum simulations, is surprisingly much more robust against forcing variations than the scars observed for electrons.},
